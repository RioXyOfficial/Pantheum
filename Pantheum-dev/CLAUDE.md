This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with this repository.

## Project

[ALPHA] Pantheum — Starcraft-inspired RTS, Unity 6 (6000.3.6f1), URP 17.3.0.

## Key Packages

- URP 17.3.0 — all shaders/materials must be URP-compatible
- Input System 1.18.0 — use new Input System only (no legacy `Input.*` API)
- AI Navigation 2.0.9 — `NavMeshAgent` for all unit movement
- Unity Test Framework 1.6.0 — tests run via Window → Test Runner (no CLI)

## Architecture

### BuildingManager — Tracking Limits

`BuildingManager` is a Singleton that tracks building counts per `BuildingType` and
provides limit queries scaling with Castle tier counts.

```
BuildingManager (Singleton)
  - Dictionary<BuildingType, int> _counts
  - List<Castle>[] _castlesByTier          // index 0=T1, 1=T2, 2=T3

  + void Register(BuildingBase b)
  + void Unregister(BuildingBase b)
  + int GetCastleCount(int tier)
  + int GetLimit(BuildingType type)
      // Returns: baseLimits[type] * GetCastleCount(requiredTier[type])
      // Castle itself: returns int.MaxValue
  + bool CanPlace(BuildingType type)
      // counts[type] < GetLimit(type)
  + bool TierRequirementMet(BuildingType type)
      // GetCastleCount(requiredTier[type]) > 0
```

- `BuildingBase.Awake()` calls `BuildingManager.Instance.Register(this)`
- `BuildingBase.OnDestroy()` calls `BuildingManager.Instance.Unregister(this)`
- T2 building limits scale with `GetCastleCount(tier: 2)` (mixed-tier rule)

### WorkerController — FSM

```
enum WorkerState { Idle, MovingToResource, Harvesting, MovingToDeposit,
                   Depositing, MovingToBuild, Building }
```

- `homeBase` (Castle) is assigned at spawn and **never changes**
- Multiple Workers can share one `ConstructionSite`; each calls `site.Tick(deltaTime)`
- Workers are **not** part of the global Supply Cap

### Health/Progress UI — Decoupling

Three pure interfaces in `UI/`:
- `IHealthDisplay` — updated by `BuildingBase` and `UnitBase` on health change
- `IProgressDisplay` — updated by `ConstructionSite` each frame while building
- `IWorkerCountDisplay` — updated by `Castle` on every worker register/unregister

`TempWorldUI` implements all three via `OnGUI()` (Unity IMGUI). Each consumer holds:

```csharp
[SerializeField] private MonoBehaviour _healthDisplayProvider;
private IHealthDisplay _healthDisplay; // resolved in Awake via as-cast
```

To replace the UI later: implement the interfaces in a new component, swap the
Inspector reference — zero changes to game logic.

### Castle Worker Registry

- Each Castle tracks its own Workers independently (max 15)
- Renders "X / 15" world-space label **unconditionally** (not gated on selection)
- 16th Worker spawn is rejected by the Castle before it is created

### ConstructionSite — Parallel Tracking

- Tracks two parallel floats: `currentHealth` (0 → maxHealth) and `buildProgress` (0 → 1)
- Both advance at the same rate while a Worker is actively building
- Displays a Health Bar **and** a Progress Bar simultaneously
- On `buildProgress == 1`: replace site with finished building at full health, Worker → Idle

## Out of Scope

No animations/VFX, no audio, no multiplayer, no complex pathfinding, no UI polish.

## Verification Checklist

1. Place a Castle → "0 / 15" label renders without selecting it
2. Spawn 15 Workers → label reads "15 / 15"; 16th Worker is rejected
3. Place a construction site → Health Bar and Progress Bar both advance simultaneously
4. Build completes → Health is full, Progress bar disappears, Worker returns to Idle
5. Place T2 building → blocked when only T1 Castles exist
6. Build a T2 Castle → T2 building limit unlocks
7. Produce a Knight → Supply Cap increments; produce a Worker → it does NOT
